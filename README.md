<summary> Problem Statement</summary>

Digital payment platforms are increasingly targeted by fraudsters through **QR scams, phishing messages, and social engineering attacks**.  
Users often unknowingly authorize fraudulent transactions.

This project addresses the challenge of:

**"Strengthening Fraud Prevention in Digital Payment Systems."**

SentryPay introduces a **multi-layer defense architecture** to detect and prevent fraudulent payment attempts before the transaction is completed.

<summary> Proposed Solution</summary>

SentryPay implements a **Cognitive Multi-Layer Fraud Prevention System** that protects users during digital payments.

The system integrates four intelligent security layers:

1. **Scam Language Detection**  
   Detects suspicious or manipulative language in payment requests.

2. **QR Code Intelligence**  
   Analyzes QR code data and flags potentially malicious payment receivers.

3. **Intent Verification AI**  
   Confirms the user's payment intent before allowing transactions.

4. **Live Liveness Authentication**  
   Uses facial liveness detection (blink detection) to verify a real user.

These layers work together to **prevent fraudulent payments before completion**.

<summary> System Workflow</summary>

1. User opens **SentryPay**
2. User scans a **QR code**
3. System analyzes the QR data
4. Fraud detection engine checks risk
5. If **safe → payment page opens**
6. If **fraud → scam alert is shown**
7. User authentication verifies identity
8. Transaction proceeds securely
